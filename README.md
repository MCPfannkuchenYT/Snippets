# Snippets
This is a very useful program for developers.

## What does it do?
This Program is a library of clipboards. You can instantly load/save them to a file, which will be listed in the program.

## How do I install it?
Once you double Click the JAR, it'll put itself into the Autostart folder of windows. This is located under<br>
<code>%AppData%/Microsoft/Windows/Startmenu/Programs/Autostart</code>
If your Anti-Virus doesn't like that, you can ofc just copy the jar by hand.
## How do I use it?
From this point on, you can always click <Windows + F> and a small Window will open.
From there you can load/save Clipboards!
